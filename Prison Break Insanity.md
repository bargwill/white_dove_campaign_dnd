The Clockwork Conservatory is one of the most ancient prison facilities of MOrningstar. Similar to the city it's a part of, it is a marvel of new technology. Cells which cancel out all magic, jailors and guards that work around the clock without ever needing to rest, while protecting the facilities from any sort of riot. It is said that in the highest tower of the jail, some of the worst criminals that history has ever seen are imprisoned. But this is not a story about them, this is a story about humble adventurers, who found themselves in trouble far bigger than they anticipated.

## 1.1. Not a Holiday Resort

**GM NOTE:** Before starting the adventure, give out the bits of information below to your players in private. This is to encourage roleplay at the beginning of the adventure.

Read this:

'You find yourselves in a barren room, barely enough hay mattresses to accommodate all of you, a pierced bucket in the corner with the purposes of being a latrine, and the scent of rat urine, rotting corpses and decaying rations surrounding you. You find yourself without any equipment or weapon, only wearing your prison garb. Lovely location to spend your last days, unless you can manage to postpone your fate. For now you can feel the searing pain caused by the shackles around your wrists.'

Each character is outfitted with [Sturdy Manacles](http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-Mdqn3Nc5WaAz9bc0QWA), which they've had to wear since the beginning of their imprisonment, without ever getting out of them.

The players that possess magic will realize that magic doesn't seem to work for them at all. Each prison cell is affected by a modified [Antimagic Field](http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-MdqlxGLc0Z9hXUAeHKL) spell which prevents the casting of any magic or magical effect.

The players will also be contacted by Barvor at this point, whether or not they took his deal. He will either check in with them (if they did take it) or explain things to them if they did not. Either way, he will hope that the players are willing to let his comrades out (Smokey Shep, Larissa the Snake, and Willow.) They are being held in another cell somewhere else in the prison. If the players had not taken his deal, he will add that he believes they recovered some artifacts that the players may have use for.

## 1.2. Plotting the Escape

The character's have access to the following information that they have gleaned over the course of their stay in jail, working in the kitchens or the mines:

- Either a character has managed to sneak some outside help in. If so perhaps they swallowed a hair pin, which they can regurgitate once entering the cell, to try to undo the shackles. (GM's choice)
- Tomorrow the warden is out of the prison system, which means that its security is lowest.
- The party can cause ruckus in the cell causing some guards to come in. Whilst the guards are in one party member can attempt to snag a piece of metal from their armor that could be used to pick/break the lock.

For encouraging roleplay I suggest parsing out the information in between your players. Once your players realize how to potentially escape, the adventure can proceed forward.

## 1.3. A Plan in Motion

If you've given the players a hairpin, consider it Thieve's Tool for the purpose of the Sleight of Hand check of the manacles. Trying to open the lock to the cell with the pin requires a **DC 17 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check**. On a success the gate opens. On a failure, the pin breaks and they have to resort to the other strategy to attract the [jailor](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-MdW-P2Fg2rZzuipYvyU) in and get the gate to open.

If the players have decided on making chaos to attract a guard, a nearby jailor will walk in front of the cell. Jailors can open the cells at will without requiring the key. First it will use its Imprison Action, clearly showing that it wants the fight to end (Jailors cannot talk). If the fight continues despite that, it will walk in the cell, positioning itself at the entrance so no creature can escape. Roll Initiative for everyone. 2 rounds later 3 more [jailor](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-MdW-P2Fg2rZzuipYvyU)s will show up.

The jailors will only knock unconscious those who are fighting them, not trying to kill anyone. While the fight is going on, a character can attempt to snag a piece of metal from a jailor, requiring a **DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check**. On a failure, the jailor will beat the creature unconscious and retrieve the scrap metal. If all attempts fail, once the fight is over, the character with the highest Passive Perception will notice that a piece of scrap metal fell to the floor, hidden by the hay. During the fight the manacles can be used as improvised weapons, but magic doesn't function in the room, although the Jailor's aren't affected by the [Antimagic Field](http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-MdqlxGLc0Z9hXUAeHKL).

 Either option is considered to have happened the day before the escape. Once the jailors leave the cell, the party can take a long rest. Recovering all resources expended during the fight. They'll notice that the piece of metal they snagged can be used as Thieve's Tools for the purposes of locks inside the Clockwork Conservatory.

 The next day, after the long rest read this:

'Today is the day, the warden is gone, there is an air of tension in your room, you know that now is your only chance to act. The piece of steel that you stole yesterday lays hidden in your room, and you know what to do with it, you can almost smell the air of freedom, almost, but a perilous mission is ahead of you.'

The players can now attempt to break out of their prison cell, the door requires a **DC 14 Dexterity (Thieve's Tool) check** to open. The players need to time it with the round of the guards, they have a 30 minute window each hour where they can attempt an escape.

On a success, read this:

'After fidgeting with the lock for the better part of 10 minutes, it finally clicks in place, with a very quiet sound, the lock opens, the corridor is there right before you, no guards in sight, now you need to make it out of these walls'

On a failure, read this:

'After fidgeting with the lock for the better part of 10 minutes, the scrap metal escapes your hands, not reacting to tension as you have expected it to. As it crashes on the floor, a loud "TING" is heard, echoing throughout the corridor. You hear a door open in the distance, someone is coming.'

The players now need to hide while a jailor comes patrolling to check on the sound. Once the jailor leaves they may attempt the check again, give them advantage on the check. If they fail once more the [jailor](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-MdW-P2Fg2rZzuipYvyU) will walk in the cell, ransacking it in search of what's causing the sound. The players need to succeed on a **Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check** contested by the Jailor's **Intelligence (Investigation) check**. On a failure a fight breaks out, but no reinforcement is coming around this time. If the jailor is stripped of its armor, players will realise that it is [chain mail](http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-MdqmuiD-TBX9-pfbiZy) armor that they can use, and that the key shaped sword is a [greatsword](http://journal.roll20.net/handout/-MdqmrEdkTEagbpwbxwf).

Either way once this section is over, move to the next chapter.

In which the players make their way through the Clockwork Conservatory.

## 2.1. The Ground Floor

In which the players pass through the first level of the Conservatory

### Areas of The Ground Floor

###

#### 1 - Jail Cell

This is the cell in which the characters were imprisoned. It contains nothing of interest. The players can attempt to hide there and close the door behind them if they are detected by the guards. It requires a group (take the average of the entire group) **DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check** for the guards to believe them or a **DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check** for them to rush in fast enough.

#### 2 - Guard's Station

A jailor is stationed there, the party needs to succeed on a **DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check**, or be noticed by the guard which will stand up. Refer to Area 1 to see the party's options. They can also decide to attack the [Jailor](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-MdW-P2Fg2rZzuipYvyU) instead. If they do attack, the other guards in area 3 will come in reinforcement. Urge the players to retreat towards area 4.

The players will note that the jailor is crouched, examining jeffers, who has two tiny cymbals attached to his hands. The jailor appears to be frustrated and is trying to figure out how Jeffers works.

#### 3 - Guard's Barracks

The players know this is where the guards are stationed most of the time. This room is filled with 6 [jailor](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-MdW-P2Fg2rZzuipYvyU)s, the party can try to see through the keyhole, requiring a **DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check **to notice all of them, on a 10 to 13, only half the jailors are seen, under a 10, the room appears empty through the keyhole. If the players enter the room they are immediately attacked by all the jailors who are present. It is very unlikely that the players can win this fight, especially unarmed, so urge them to retreat towards area 4, where they can attempt to collapse the corridor to buy themselves some time.

#### 4 - Support Beam

A horizontal log of what looks to be very used wood is barely holding up the stone structure above it. The beam has 10 AC and 5 hit points, if it is destroyed the ceiling collapses, completely blocking the corridor. Players can use this to buy themselves time, as it will take the jailors 30 minutes to clear the area and proceed forward. Although after 10 minutes one jailor will manage to sneak through and attack the party, with killing intent this time. If a player is located under the ceiling when it collapses, they must succeed on a **DC 12 Dexterity Saving throw** or take 3d8 bludgeoning damage and end up on the side of the wall away from the guards.

#### 5 - Main Gate Room

####


The stairs opposite the gate lead to the floor above but are not as benign as they seem. A deadly trap, signature to Thalen Mistshadow, the former leader of the Red Hand and a previous acquaintance of Knox, lies in wait. Players with a passive investigation of 14 or higher will notice it immediately. If triggered, the stairs morph into a slippery slide. Each player must succeed on a **DC 14 Dexterity saving throw** or slide prone to the bottom, taking 1d10 bludgeoning damage on a failure. The trap unceremoniously deposits those who fail into area 6.

_DM Note_: If Knox inspects the trap, memories of Thalen's flawed but clever designs come flooding back. If Knox chooses to share this information, it could provide the group with a crucial advantage during their treacherous ascent.

#### 6 - The Spiral Tower

####


Read this:

_'With a crash, you tumble out of the stairs and take in your surroundings. The base of a towering spiral staircase stretches out before you, darkness consuming the upper reaches.  Before you can consider arming yourselves, three figures step out of the surrounding shadows - jailors, their blades glinting ominously in the dim light. Roll Initiative.'_

_DM Note_: As the tension mounts, Jonnoc's trained eye catches something hauntingly familiar about the jailors. Their stance, the way they grip their blades, the rhythm of their movements - it's the signature of the "Iron Whirlwind" - a fighting style that was taught exclusively in the military battalion Jonnoc once served in. It was designed for close-quarter combat, focusing on rapid, tight swings and sudden direction changes to confuse and overpower opponents.

If Jonnoc makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check at the start of each of his turns, he can recall the counter-tactics he learned during his military service. If successful, read the following:

"Jonnoc, as you ready yourself for the jailors' attacks, you fall back onto the training drilled into you years ago. You recognize their Iron Whirlwind stance - the swift, tight swings, the sudden shifts in direction, the predatory circling. But you also remember the counter: the "Stone Bulwark" stance. You plant your feet firmly, keep your center of gravity low, and prepare to parry their rapid strikes with calculated, heavy blows of your own. With these memories guiding your moves, you gain an advantage on your first attack this round."

## 2.2. The Ascension

Once the fight is over the players can choose to go directly up the stairs, as it is the only direction, alternatively they can take time to catch their breath before moving on.

If they indeed choose to take a breath, read the following:

'As the last of you finish donning armor, you catch a strange scent in the air. As you look to your feet, a gas seems to be surging from the floor. From the looks of it, some form of trap was activated, every cell in your body is telling you to run.'

The guards have uncovered the escape and unleashed a security system, filling the air with toxic smoke that will knock any creature that needs to breathe unconscious.

If they do not armor up and choose to go up directly, read this:

'As you steadily climb the stairs, about halfway there, you realize that a strange scent is filling the air. As you look to your feet, a gas seems to be surging from the floor, already filling the lower half of the tower. From the looks of it, some form of trap was activated, every cell in your body is telling you to run.'

**Toxic Fumes:**

A creature that starts its turn inside the fumes, or enters them for the first time on their turn must succeed on a **DC 14 Constitution saving throw** or take 1d12 poison damage. The DC increases by 1 for each consecutive turn spent in the smoke. Constructs are immune to this effect. The smoke climbs up the wall at a speed of 20 feet per round. If a creature falls to 0 hit point due to the fumes, it automatically stabilizes.

The players now need to start running faster than the gas alongside the walls of the tower, until they emerge in another room. Along the stairs, about half way up, they will encounter another set of 4 [jailor](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-MdW-P2Fg2rZzuipYvyU)s and a [Clockwork Hound](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-MdqlneqZEs23ysgWSdS) that will block the path. The jailors will try to knock them off the platform to fall in the gas below. At that point the players are about 200 feet up when the jailors encounter them.

Read this:

'As you rush up the stairs, falling from the floor above, and crashing on the floor in front of you, two jailors unleash their blades, on the wall next to them, a hound made of metal is planting its claws in the walls, growling in your direction. Roll Initiative.'

If the players have only been running from the gas, and using their Action to Dash each turn until the encounter, the gas will take 4 turns (5 if you want to be lenient) to arrive in the battle.

_DM Note_: As the gas continues to surge, one of the party members may notice a pattern in the gas's release. If they make a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Survival) check, they can use their action to guide the group, exploiting the pattern and enabling everyone to move an additional 10 feet during their turn for the next few rounds.

The players climb off the rest of the tower, running away from the ever climbing fumes, they reach the last floor of the windowless prison.

## 3.1. Teleportation

In which the players find a new device.

After the battle is over read this:

'As the metallic remains clatter to the floor, the defeated jailors fall to their knees. The air is hard to breath, as the toxic fumes are lurking close, now is not the moment to celebrate, you still need to find a way out of this madness.'

Upon reaching the tower's final floor, the party encounters what appears to be a teleportation device. To understand its workings, a character must succeed on a **DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana)** check.

Knox, with his past experience working alongside Thalen, recognizes the design of the device. Thalen had often spoken of his dream to create a localized teleportation device, accessible via a magical map. Because of this familiarity, Knox has advantage on the Intelligence (Arcana) check.

On a successful check, a magical map depicting the top floor's layout appears, showing the contents of each room and allowing the party to choose their teleportation destination.

If the check fails, it can be retried every 12 seconds, until the encroaching fumes threaten to suffocate the party.

Should the check fail, Knox, remembering Thalen's unconventional design quirks, can attempt to bypass the device's normal operation. This allows the party to select their teleportation destination, even on a failed check, but with the risk of malfunction due to the device's tampering.

Alternatively, on a failed check, the party can still force their way into the teleportation device. Roll 1d4 to determine the teleportation destination.

## 3.2. The Last Floor

In which the players contend with the dangers of the last floor.

### Areas of The Last Floor

#### 1. Tower

This is where the players are located, and where the teleportation device is, after clearing each room, the device becomes active again and the players can teleport back to the tower, before moving forward to another room.

#### 2. Cell 1

This cell is occupied by the three Red Hand prisoners the party has been tasked with rescuing: Melody Windsong, a hapless human bard convinced of her non-existent musical prowess; Lorim Quicksilver, the halfling rogue; and Elyna Shadowfoot, the half-elf ranger. Initially wary, they will cooperate with the players if treated kindly. The trio is on a mission to recruit the steel dragon atop the prison for their leader, Barvor. They won't reveal this information unless pressed.

A careful search of the cell (DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check) uncovers two hidden potions of healing.

Lorim Quicksilver: Lorim is an expert in stealth and the go-to scout for the Red Hand. He has a cheeky and mischievous personality, always cracking a joke even in the direst of situations. Despite his light-hearted nature, he is fiercely loyal to his companions and the cause they fight for. He hails from a peaceful halfling village that was ravaged by a tyrannical lord, an event that propelled him into a life of rebellion. Lorim is the one who tolerates Melody's awful music, often offering exaggerated applause and encouragement to keep their spirits high. He carries a set of masterwork lockpicks, a souvenir from a particularly challenging heist, that he managed to keep hidden from his captors.

Elyna Shadowfoot: Elyna is skilled in tracking and survival, essential for the team's covert operations in hostile territories. Quiet and reserved, she lets her actions speak louder than her words. Her keen eyes and instinctive understanding of her surroundings make her a formidable infiltrator. She was born to a human father and an elven mother, and joined the Red Hand after witnessing the harm the automatons were causing to the natural world. Elyna is the more pragmatic of the group, often exasperated by Melody's music, but she values the harmony within the group more than her musical preferences. She has a pet raven named Obsidian, used for reconnaissance, captured along with them and kept in a cage in the corner of the cell.

Melody Windsong: Melody is a human bard with a flair for dramatics and an unshakeable belief in her non-existent musical talent. Her optimism and energy, though sometimes misplaced, are infectious and often keep the team's spirits high in challenging times. She believes her "music" is a weapon against tyranny and is convinced her discordant tunes will be the song of victory against their oppressors. She carries an old, battered lute, a gift from her mentor, which she treasures more than anything else.

**DM Roleplaying Notes:**

Melody Windsong: Melody is the heart of the group. She is overly enthusiastic, somewhat naive, and ever-optimistic. When speaking as Melody, fill your voice with pep and energy. Sing her words, off-key and off-rhythm, as if she's trying to make every sentence into a song. When things get tense, Melody tries to lighten the mood with a song or a joke, even if no one else finds it funny or appropriate. She sees herself as a beacon of hope, and she's committed to spreading joy, even if her methods are unconventional.

Lorim Quicksilver: As Lorim, you should always have a quick joke or a light-hearted comment ready. Even when the situation is dire, Lorim finds a way to make light of it. He's the kind of person who laughs in the face of danger - not because he's not afraid, but because he believes in facing fear with a smile. He's fiercely loyal and protective of his friends, especially Melody, whom he encourages despite her lack of musical talent. When roleplaying Lorim, use a cheerful and jovial voice, and don't forget to laugh a lot.

Elyna Shadowfoot: Elyna is the stoic, silent type. She is pragmatic, straightforward, and a woman of few words. She prefers to let her actions speak for her, but when she does speak, her words carry weight. She is often the voice of reason among the group and is not afraid to call out her companions if they're being reckless. However, underneath her tough exterior, she cares deeply about her companions and their cause. She might roll her eyes at Melody's off-key singing, but she will defend her fiercely if anyone else criticizes her. When roleplaying Elyna, speak sparingly and with conviction, and use a calm, firm voice.

#### 3. Guard's Upper Office

Two upgraded clockwork hounds guard this room, their mechanical bodies gleaming with enhanced construction. They snarl and snap at the party, presenting a tougher challenge than their predecessors. Knox, however, remains unimpressed by their design, realizing their weaknesses. If Knox makes a successful DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check to analyze their mechanisms, he can exploit their vulnerabilities to deal an additional damage die on one of his attacks and spells against them. This DC gets easier each round, but must be repeated as the hounds adapt.

After a fierce battle, the clockwork hounds lay broken and motionless on the ground. As the echoes of the fight fade away, the sound of approaching guards from below urges the party to make a swift exit.

Among the scattered gears and twisted metal in the room, the players notice a chest. It is locked tightly, and a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools or a spell such as Knock is required to unlock it. If the players have already rescued the Red Hand members, they can easily open the chest and retrieve their possessions within.

Beside the chest lies another, larger and more ornate. This second chest emanates a faint magical aura. A sense of anticipation fills the air as the party eagerly inspects its contents. Inside, they find several enticing magical items. They find an Amulet of Health, a Cloak of Elvenkind, Gauntlets of Ogre Power, Ring of Protection, and Boots of Striding and springing, as well as 500 gold pieces. It is clear this chest was used to hold the more valuable items from the prisoners.

But there, nestled amidst the magical treasures, lies the object of their quest—the final piece of the ancient and magical staff they have been tirelessly searching for. Its surface radiates with a soft, pulsating glow, as if infused with ancient power. As the players lay their eyes upon it, a surge of hope and triumph fills their hearts, for they are now one step closer to unlocking the staff's true potential and fulfilling their destiny.

#### 4. Cell 2

Cell 2 Upon entering this room, you're met with a chilling sight. The floor is stained with fresh, dark blood that emits a strong iron scent. As you step further into the room, you feel a sudden drop in temperature, and a sense of unease begins to creep in. This cell, devoid of magic like the ones below, once housed the prisoner now confined in the torture chamber. The stairways leading up and down are collapsed, a testament to past violence that occurred here.

As you investigate the room, you notice strange markings on the wall, seemingly scratched in by desperate hands. The markings appear to be some form of code or possibly a language that none of you recognize. It seems to tell a story, but without deciphering the code, it remains a mystery.

Suddenly, you hear faint whispering sounds that seem to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. It's too quiet to make out any discernible words, but it sends a shiver down your spine.

These whispers, upon further investigation, are the ethereal remnants of a spectral prisoner who was tortured and died in this cell. The spirit is not malicious but stuck in a loop of its final moments. Its whispers might become clearer if the players perform a ritual, use a spell like 'Speak with Dead,' or if they possess an item related to the spirit.

If the players choose to communicate with the spirit, they uncover a chilling revelation. The spirit sputters out a dire message: "The city is overrun with Automatons. We don't know how many of the living are left free. Things are dire. There is no escape." This grave information provides a grim context to the situation outside the prison walls and might prompt the party to rethink their escape plan or the larger mission at hand

#### 5. Torture Chamber

Read This:

'With a sudden flash of light, you materialize within a new, horrifying room. Immediately, your eyes are drawn to a grisly sight. A woman, her body contorted unnaturally, is suspended in a macabre tableau. Multiple spears impale her torso, their cruel points protruding from her blood-drenched form. Chains, anchored within the walls, bind her limbs, stretching her out in a grotesque imitation of a cross.

Suddenly, she stirs, and her head lifts weakly. Despite the blood obscuring her features, a spark of life flickers in her eyes. A chilling laughter, weak yet defiant, echoes within the room.

In that moment, the Voyager freezes. There's something familiar about that face, that laugh. He can't exactly place how he knows her, but there's an undeniable sense of recognition.

Four menacing Jailors and a formidable Shield Guardian stand guard over the prisoner. The Shield Guardian is primed with a 4th level slow spell, set to be unleashed when its health dips below half (DC 18).

For the purposes of the combat, the prisoner is impervious to damage, her life force persisting despite the torturous conditions. This strange resilience hints at a hidden power, but her true nature remains concealed. Additionally, as long as the Shield Guardian stands, the shackles binding the prisoner are indestructible.'

## 3.3. Explosive Escape

**The Liberation of Nivara**

Once the enemies are defeated, the players can attempt to destroy the shackles holding the woman. As soon as one of them breaks, the woman speaks: "Thank you, young ones." She immediately pulls the spears out of her, and her wounds begin to heal rapidly before their eyes.

_Roleplay note_: Use a calm, serene tone for Nivara's voice. She is grateful, but not overly emotional.

**Adrenaline Crystals**

On a rack near the torture devices, the players will notice some magical crystals that seem to pulse with energy. There are 12 crystals here, and the red hand will agree to split them 7-5 with the players. Nivara will have some insight - these were used to quickly heal torture victims so that the awful things being done could be continued, while draining the victim of all their energy.

**Conversation with Nivara**

Nivara, pulling the last of the spears out of her body and standing tall, looks down at the three Red Hand bandits. She smiles warmly, "So, you are the ones who have come to liberate me. I heard your organization has been causing quite a stir."

Melody steps forward, "Indeed, we are envoys from the Red Hand. We seek your help, mighty Nivara. Will you join our cause?"

Nivara chuckles, the sound echoing in the crumbling tower. She turns to the players, "And you, brave ones, I can tell you are not with these three, but you have fought well. What say you? Do you believe in their cause? Do you think joining them is a wise decision?"

_Roleplay note_: Nivara is testing the players here, not just for their strength, but their hearts as well. Encourage your players to speak their minds here. Her decision to join the Red Hand will largely be influenced by their sincerity and passion for the cause of freedom.

**Nivara's Past**

If the players ask how Nivara was captured, she will explain the following: Nivara's gaze becomes distant, and she begins to recount the events that led to her capture. "I was deceived," she admits, her voice heavy with regret. "I received word from a trusted ally that an artifact, very valuable to me, had been stolen, and that it was being held in the city of Morningstar. Despite my better judgment, I allowed my baser instincts to take over. I flew into a rage and rushed to reclaim what was mine."

She pauses, a pained expression crossing her face. "I was met by a force I did not expect. The Black Knight, a being of man and machine, used his cunning to trick me. He simulated an attack on innocent beings, knowing I would intervene. And when I did, he used enchanted shackles to restrain me. They were powerful, capable of limiting even my abilities." She laughs, grimly. "And do you want to know the best part? I never even confirmed with my own eyes. For all I know, the object is safe and sound to this day, right where I last left it."

_Roleplay note_: Nivara's tone is self-reflective here. She is not just recounting her past, but also grappling with her mistakes.

"I was taken here, and they tried to kill me. But they were unable. I was left in the weakened state you saw here." She sighs "So the answer to how I was captured? It was a mistake, one that I deeply regret. I allowed my anger to cloud my judgment, and I paid the price."

The players can continue talking to her here, either convincing her to join with the Red Hand or not. Either way, she will agree to help them escape the city. "By doing this," is all she will say if the players ask how they will escape.

**Nivara's Transformation**

Suddenly, there's a distinct change in the atmosphere. The air shivers with power, a pulse of pure energy emanates from Nivara. Her body begins to shimmer and ripple, her figure blurring and distorting, as if viewed through a heat haze. Her skin takes on a metallic sheen, her form expanding and twisting in a spectacular display of transformation.

With a thunderous crash, her wings unfold, breaking through the confines of the walls, revealing the sprawling city below. Stone and dust rain down from the gaping hole left behind, but Nivara stands unscathed amidst the destruction, her majestic form now fully revealed as an adult steel dragon.

"Shall we?" She asks, the timbre of her voice now echoing with a resonating depth. Regardless of her decision to join the Red Hand, she offers them a route of escape. The players then load onto her back and fly out over the city, getting a bird's eye view of the challenges they face.

**The Flight Over Morningstar**

As the players load onto Nivara's majestic back, her massive wings unfurl, and a surge of power propels them into the open sky. They soar high above the city, looking down upon the mechanical landscape below.

Beneath them, the city sprawls like a vast canvas of cold metal and gears. Streets once teeming with life are now empty, devoid of any signs of human or elven presence. Clockwork automatons, acting on their programmed instincts, patrol the streets with mechanical precision, their footsteps echoing in the eerie silence. The once-familiar buildings stand as hollow shells, their windows shattered, and their walls bearing the scars of past conflicts.

From this bird's eye view, the players gain a stark realization of the city's desolation. No signs of resistance or human activity can be seen, only the unrelenting march of the soulless constructs that now dominate the urban landscape. The city stands as a haunting testament to the devastation wrought by the automatons, a testament to the challenges they face in their quest for freedom.

The players hold on tight as Nivara carries them further, offering them a glimpse of the daunting journey that lies ahead.

_Roleplay notes_: Remember, Nivara is wise and old, but she's also kind and has a sense of humor. Don't be afraid to make her chuckle at a particularly audacious statement or to gently chide a player for a hasty decision. And remember, despite her immense power, she won't be easily swayed by simple words. The players' actions and sincerity will weigh heavily on her decision.

### 4. The Final Flight

As the players mount up on Nivara's back, they fly out over Morningstar, the once bustling capital of the human kingdom of Weria, now eerily silent and encased in a shimmering forcefield of magical energy. The cityscape below is an uncanny blend of ancient architecture and modern innovation, a testament to its rapid expansion through the use of magic. Tall, grandiose buildings stand alongside an intricate network of clockwork mechanisms, their gleaming gears and cogs intertwining with the city's brick and stone.

Expecting to see bustling streets and a city teeming with life, the players are instead met with a shocking sight: empty streets and a conspicuous absence of human inhabitants. Automatons, once the workforce of the city, now patrol the streets aimlessly. Despite the absence of life, the city is pristine, every surface polished to a shine. It's as if the city continues to function perfectly, only without its living soul. The sight is unsettling, the emptiness a haunting reminder of the city's past vibrance. It's a ghost city, a chilling monument to the power of unchecked magic and uncontrolled technology.

Suddenly, their silent contemplation is shattered by the deafening sound of metallic wings cutting through the air. Out of nowhere, a dark figure collides with Nivara, causing the players to grip tightly onto her scales as their comrades are thrown off. With a final strum of his lute, the bard casts slow fall, and they drift safely towards the city below.

Out of the smoke and chaos, a familiar, armored figure emerges - the Black Knight. Clad in black armor and bearing a gleaming, menacing sword, it soars through the air with an eerie grace. Its red eyes fixate on the party, and with a roar, it charges. Roll for initiative.

### 4.1 Black Knight Aerial Battle

As the party absorbs the haunting sights of Morningstar, a sudden roar shatters the silence. From the smoke and haze, the Black Knight bursts forth, slamming into Nivara with a mechanical precision. The impact sends the three Red Hand bandits flying off Nivara, their descent slowed by a timely casting of slow fall.

The Black Knight, an automaton of flesh shrouded in the aura of undeath, fixes its eerie red gaze on the party. It is an intimidating sight, its once-human form twisted into a relentless killing machine. Roll for initiative.

#### **Initiative:** The Black Knight always goes first in the first round of combat due to its mechanical reflexes.

####


#### **Battlefield Features:**

Every time the Black Knight loses 10% of its total health, roll a d6 to determine the battlefield's state:

1-2: **Difficult Terrain** due to Nivara's movements. Players must make a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to move.

3-4: **Dragon's Blessing** - Nivara grants players Advantage on their next attack roll or saving throw.

5-6: **Sudden Shift** - Nivara's sudden movements require players to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being thrown off, missing their next turn.

### 4.2 Battle in the City Streets

As the battle intensifies, the Black Knight lands a devastating blow on Nivara. With a pained roar, she spirals downwards, crashing into the city streets. The impact sends a cloud of dust and debris into the air, obscuring vision temporarily. Nivara lies unconscious, her breathing heavy and strained.

_DM Note: This phase of the fight should start when the Black Knight reaches half of its hit points._

As Nivara crashes into the ground, the force of the impact sends debris flying and leaves her momentarily unconscious. The players find themselves scattered amidst the rubble of Morningstar, the Black Knight still standing strong. The automaton of flesh, a horrifying blend of undeath and clockwork technology, turns its eerie red gaze towards the party, ready to continue its relentless assault.

#### **Initiative:** The Black Knight continues with the initiative order established during the aerial battle.

####


#### **Battlefield Features:**

Every time the Black Knight loses 10% of its remaining health, roll a d6 to determine a new battlefield event:

1-2: **Difficult Terrain** - An area of loose rubble slows progress.

3: **Falling Debris** - A large piece of debris targets a random player, who must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

4: **Collapsing Building** - A small building nearby collapses, creating an area of Full Cover and a dust cloud that obscures vision for 1d4 rounds. Any creature inside the dust cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be Blinded until the start of their next turn.

5: **Sudden Pit** - A section of the street gives way, revealing a pit that is 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep. Any creature in the affected area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the pit, taking 2d6 falling damage and becoming prone.

6: **Magic Surge** - The impact of Nivara's crash destabilizes a magic energy line, causing intermittent magical surges. Any spell cast within a 20 ft. radius has a 25% chance (roll a d4, on a 1 the surge occurs) of triggering a Wild Magic Surge.

#### **Nivara's Aid:**

At the start of each round, roll a d20. On a 14-20, Nivara regains consciousness and can perform one of the following actions:

1. **Tail Swipe** - Nivara makes a tail attack against the Black Knight, with a +10 to hit. On a hit, the Black Knight takes 2d8 + 5 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

1. **Weak Dragon's Breath** - Nivara breathes out a cone of energy in the Black Knight's direction. The Black Knight must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### 4.3 The Lament of the Black Knight

The Black Knight's form flickers and sparks, then gives out. His red eyes dim, and a human figure emerges from the armored shell. This is the man the Black Knight once was, a high-ranking guard of Morningstar.

**Roleplay Note:** The guard is filled with regret and despair, horrified by his transformation into the Black Knight and haunted by the atrocities he was forced to commit. Convey this through his broken sentences, trembling voice, and horrified expressions.

The guard speaks, his voice weak but resolute. "All... all are gone... or changed. Thalen... Mistshadow... too late... too late to stop it." His words hint at a terrible fate that has befallen the city and its inhabitants, and Thalen Mistshadow's involvement.

**Roleplay Note:** Players may have questions. He can provide limited information, stating that Thalen is in the grand palace's throne room. His fragmented memory and confusion add to the mystery and urgency of the situation.

Nivara, now back in her humanoid form and still recovering, offers her support. "I will do what I can," she promises, her voice filled with determination.

The three Red Hand bandits reappear, unscathed from their fall. They look at the players, the fallen Black Knight, and the recovering Nivara, their expressions grim but resolute.

With the fallen Black Knight's directions, Nivara's and the Red Hand's support, the party is now prepared to confront Thalen Mistshadow in the grand palace's throne room, the heart of the clockwork menace.

## 5.1 The Silent City

As the party sets off towards the grand palace, the city of Morningstar unfolds before them, eerily silent yet mechanically vibrant. The roads that once echoed with the laughter of children and the haggling of merchants are now traversed by clockwork automatons, moving with a chillingly perfect rhythm. The unique blend of architectural styles, from traditional stone buildings to towering structures of magical clockwork, stand both vacant of life and yet filled with mechanical activity. Roleplay Note: Emphasize the eerie silence juxtaposed with the ceaseless mechanical activity. The city should feel like a beautiful, intricate clockwork mechanism that's continuing to function despite the absence of life and energy that once fueled it.

### Read this out:

The city lies before you, silent and still but for the mechanical whirring of clockwork constructs. Clockwork structures that once whirred with a life of their own continue their ceaseless rhythm, their gears spinning and pistons pumping. The once lively marketplace is bustling with automatons, the scent of exotic spices replaced by the sterile smell of cold metal. The city is recognizable but so very different, like a familiar song played in a minor key.

### Special Note for Rasoloj:

Rasoloj, as you look around, you recognize the streets where you once walked with Master Bastian, the shops you visited, the park where you sparred. But the city is different now. It's like a painting you know well, but the colors are off, the image distorted. The feeling is unsettling, like looking at a reflection of yourself, similar but not the same.

## 5.2 The Grand Palace:

The grand palace stands as a beacon of Morningstar's past glory and its tragic present. A stunning fusion of the city's classical architecture and the magical clockwork structures, the palace is an exquisite blend of the old and the new. The beautiful archways and intricate carvings of the old kingdom blend seamlessly with the gears and cogs of the new era, creating a hauntingly beautiful image.

### Read this out:

Before you stands the grand palace, a magnificent testament to Morningstar's past splendor and its tragic present. Majestic towers of stone and metal reach for the sky, their surfaces adorned with beautiful carvings and intricate clockwork mechanisms. Crystal windows reflect the dim light, creating a kaleidoscope of colors that dance on the deserted courtyards. The palace is an architectural marvel, blending the traditional grandeur of the old kingdom with the innovative clockwork design of the new era. It's stunning yet haunting, a symbol of Morningstar's lost vibrancy.

### Next Objective:

The party is now at the entrance of the grand palace, prepared to confront Thalen Mistshadow in the throne room. The weight of the city's fate hangs in the air, lending a grim determination to their steps as they cross the threshold into the heart of the clockwork menace.

## 5.3 The Throne of Thorns

The party notices a stark contrast upon entering the grand palace. The familiar sterility of the city's clockwork is replaced by an invasive, unnatural presence.

### Read this out:

As you step into the palace, your eyes are drawn to the thick, black roots that twist and coil across the surfaces, replacing the elegant carvings and intricate clockwork designs. The roots, glossy and dark, look as though they've been dipped in tar, their unnerving pulsations casting unsettling shadows along the grand corridors. These roots bear a striking resemblance to the trees you encountered in 'The Realm of Nightmares.' The realization hits you like a punch to the gut, the implications horrifying and yet undeniable.

Continuing their journey, the party finds the throne room to be completely dominated by the monstrous black roots.

### Read this out:

Upon entering the throne room, you are met with a monstrous black tree. Its massive trunk stands where the throne once was, its gnarled roots spreading out like a monstrous spider's web. The air is thick with a sickening, dark energy that sends chills down your spine.

At the heart of the tree, the party finds a familiar yet unexpected figure.

### Read this out:

And there, in the heart of the tree, embedded in the grotesque bark, you see a figure. It's Thalen Mistshadow, the former leader of the Red Hand. His body is weak and emaciated, his skin ghostly pale against the dark bark of the tree. His eyes meet yours, filled with a haunting mixture of regret, fear, and a glimmer of relief.

### Special Note for Knox Redleg:

Knox, you recognize him immediately, despite his weakened state. This is Thalen, the man you once followed, now a shadow of his former self.

The party is now face to face with Thalen Mistshadow, the man behind the tragedy that has befallen Morningstar. It's time to confront him and uncover the truth behind his actions.

Thalen, despite his condition, greets the party, his voice echoing in the hollow chamber. Read this out: "Thalen's voice is hoarse and weak, yet it carries a note of happiness. 'It's been so long since I've seen…anyone,' he rasps. His eyes move to Nivara, 'I hoped you would come, Nivara. I had hoped you would be the one strong enough to end this nightmare.'

#### DM Notes:

Thalen is happy to see Nivara and the party. He had hoped that Nivara, with her power, could end the menace that he inadvertently created. He's also surprised to see Knox, having not expected his presence.

Thalen expresses deep regret for his actions and explains how he ended up in his current state.

### Read this out:

'I sought power, a way to serve Morningstar, to create wonders with clockwork magic. I climbed the ranks, advising the king, building our magnificent city. But the powers granted to me by Bastian…they corrupted my mind. I fought it, rejected it, and, in a way, I won. I retained my sanity but at a great cost. The corruption retaliated, trapping me within this monstrous tree, killing everyone in this room, twisting the Black Knight into the mindless creature you battled.'

#### DM Notes:

If pressed, Thalen will admit that he was granted powers by Bastian. He used them to climb the social ladder in Morningstar, eventually becoming the king's top advisor. He created the clockwork city with these powers, but the corruption common among those with Bastian's gifts started to affect him. He tried to resist it, sending it away, but it fought back. While he kept his mind, he was imprisoned in the tree, causing the death of everyone in the throne room.

Thalen explains the rise of the automatons and the resulting purge of human life in the city.

### Read this out:

'Once I was imprisoned, I could no longer control the automatons. They became single-minded in their duties. The soldiers and jailors, obsessed with securing the city, eradicated all human life. The cleaner automatons then erased all signs of the massacre. The city was left pristine, but empty. A haunting monument to my hubris.'

### DM Notes:

Thalen will reveal that after he was imprisoned, he lost control of the automatons. They followed their programming, with the soldier and jailor automatons becoming obsessed with executing and imprisoning any humans they found, leading to the eradication of human life in Morningstar. The cleaner automatons then cleaned the city, explaining the lack of bodies and the pristine state of the city.

Thalen asks for the mercy of death, hoping to end the nightmare he has caused.

### Read this out:

'I lured you here, Nivara, with the hope that you would be the one to end this. To all of you, I beg - end this nightmare. Free me from this prison, and let Morningstar find peace at last.'

### DM Notes:

Thalen's plan was to lure Nivara here to kill him and end the menace. He feels deep regret for his actions and asks the party to end his life. If they choose to do this, it's a somber moment that concludes the tragic tale of Morningstar.

### Additional DM Notes:

Thalen was once the leader of the Red Hand but was removed from his position by Barvor. He was able to gain favor in Morningstar using his newly acquired powers to create clockwork wonders. The transformation of the Black Knight was also a result of the corruption fighting back. The Black Knight, corrupted by the mix of clockwork power and the influence of the Realm of Nightmares, was another result of Thalen's struggle against the corruption.

If the party inquires about the Realm of Nightmares, Thalen can confirm that the tree is similar to those they have seen there. The corruption has a strong connection to this realm.

Thalen was able to resist the corruption long enough to reject his powers, and while he was successful in maintaining his sanity, the corruption took physical form and ensnared him, leading to the disaster in Morningstar.

The cleaning automatons' duty to keep the city pristine has led to the eerie cleanliness and lack of evidence of the massacre in Morningstar.

Thalen deeply regrets his actions and the catastrophe they brought on Morningstar. His plea for death is his attempt to finally bring an end to the nightmare he has caused.

If the party chooses to kill Thalen, there is no combat. It's a peaceful but somber moment of mercy. If the party decides to spare Thalen or seek another solution, you may need to prepare for that. It could lead to a new quest to find a way to free Thalen without killing him, or to find a way to repair the damage done to Morningstar.

## 5.4 The Liberation of Morningstar

### Read This Out:

As the life fades from Thalen's eyes, there's an immediate response from the city around you. A deep, low hum that's been omnipresent throughout your journey in Morningstar suddenly ceases - the silence left in its wake is deafening. Then, in the distance, you hear it: a sound like glass shattering, a roar that echoes throughout the palace halls. It's the forcefield - it's dissipating. You feel a rush of fresh air sweep through the palace, bringing with it the earthy smell of nature, a scent long lost within the walls of this city.

The silence is broken again by another noise, a cacophony of clattering, grinding, and whirring as the city's myriad clockwork inhabitants cease their eternal tasks. You hear the thud of metal bodies hitting the ground, the clanging of gears coming to a halt, and the jarring screech of machines grinding against each other as they freeze mid-action. The sounds echo throughout the city, a dirge for the end of the clockwork menace.

#### DM Notes:

The liberation of Morningstar is a sensory experience for the players, even if they don't directly witness it. The cessation of the city's hum, the shattering of the forcefield, and the collapse of the clockwork inhabitants are all heard before they're seen.

When the players eventually leave the palace, they will see the aftermath: Morningstar, once a bustling clockwork city, now lies silent and still. The once busy streets are littered with the immobile forms of the clockwork beings, their lights dimmed and their gears no longer turning. The city is finally at peace.
